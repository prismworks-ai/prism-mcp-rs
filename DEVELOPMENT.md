# Development Guide

This guide covers the development workflow, build system, and contribution process for the Prism MCP SDK.

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/prismworks-ai/prism-mcp-rs
cd prism-mcp-rs

# Install Act for local CI testing (one-time setup)
# See "Development Environment Setup" section below for platform-specific instructions

# Run quick validation
make quick      # Quick local checks (format, lint, basic tests)
make local-ci   # Full sequential CI pipeline with Act
make full       # Full parallel CI (resource-intensive)
```

## Development Environment Setup

### Installing Act (GitHub Actions Local Runner)

Act lets you run GitHub Actions workflows locally, ensuring your changes will pass CI before pushing.

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install act

# Or using MacPorts
port install act
```

#### Linux
```bash
# Using package manager (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Or using Snap
sudo snap install act

# Or download binary directly
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/nektos/act/releases/latest | \
  grep "browser_download_url.*Linux.*tar.gz" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | \
  tr -d \" | wget -qi - && \
  tar xzf act_*.tar.gz && sudo mv act /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows
```powershell
# Using Chocolatey
choco install act-cli

# Or using Scoop
scoop install act

# Or using WinGet
winget install nektos.act
```

#### Verify Installation
```bash
# Check Act is installed
act --version

# List available workflows in the project
act -l
```

## Build system overview

The project uses multiple complementary build tools:

### CI Workflows

We maintain two types of CI workflows:

1. **GitHub Workflows** (`ci.yml`, `dependencies.yml`, `release.yml`)
   - Run automatically on GitHub Actions
   - Full parallel execution across multiple OS and Rust versions
   - Generate coverage and benchmark reports
   - Handle releases and dependency updates

2. **Local Workflow** (`ci-local.yml`)
   - Designed for Act (local GitHub Actions runner)
   - Sequential execution to conserve local resources
   - Auto-detects environment and exits gracefully on GitHub
   - Same checks as GitHub CI but optimized for local machines

**Using Local CI:**
```bash
# Recommended: Sequential CI for local testing
make local-ci

# Alternative: Run full GitHub CI locally (resource-intensive)
make full

# Run specific jobs
act -j test
act -j clippy
```

### Makefile (Primary interface)

The Makefile provides convenient targets for common development tasks. It serves as the primary interface for developers, wrapping more complex commands in simple, memorable targets.

**Key targets:**

| Target | Purpose | When to use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `make quick` | Format, lint, basic tests | Before every commit |
| `make check` | Standard CI checks | Before pushing |
| `make full` | Complete CI pipeline | Before releases |
| `make docs-open` | Generate and view docs | When writing documentation |
| `make coverage` | Generate coverage report | To check test coverage |

**Daily workflow:**

```bash
# Local CI with Act (runs GitHub Actions locally)
make local-ci        # Run sequential CI pipeline locally (resource-friendly)
make full            # Run full GitHub CI pipeline locally (parallel, resource-intensive)

# Using Act directly
act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml push        # Run main CI workflow
act -W .github/workflows/ci-local.yml push  # Run local sequential CI
act -j test          # Run specific job from ci.yml
act -l               # List all available workflows and jobs

# Debugging CI failures
act -v push          # Verbose output to see what's happening
act -n push          # Dry run to see what would execute

# Quick local development (if you have Rust installed)
make quick           # Format, lint, and basic tests
make check           # Standard CI checks before pushing
```

### build.rs (Cargo build script)

The `build.rs` file is minimal by design. It only handles essential build-time tasks:

- Sets environment variables for version information
- Configures rebuild triggers for important files
- Does NOT generate documentation (handled by docs.rs automatically)

This follows Rust best practices for library crates where documentation is generated by the documentation service.

### Local CI with Act (Recommended)

**Run GitHub Actions locally!** Act executes your actual GitHub Actions workflows on your machine.

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ Test CI changes without pushing to GitHub
- ✅ Uses GitHub's official runner images
- ✅ Supports secrets, matrices, and most GitHub Actions features
- ✅ Single source of truth - your `.github/workflows/` files
- ✅ No custom CI scripts to maintain

**Available workflows:**

| Workflow | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| CI Pipeline | `act push` | Run main CI workflow (test, lint, coverage) |
| Specific Job | `act -j test` | Run only the test job |
| Pull Request | `act pull_request` | Simulate PR checks |
| Security | `act workflow_dispatch -W .github/workflows/security.yml` | Security audit |
| Benchmarks | `act -W .github/workflows/benchmarks.yml` | Performance tests |
| List All | `act -l` | Show all available workflows and jobs |

**Common Act commands:**

```bash
# Run default push event workflows
act push

# Run with specific event
act pull_request
act workflow_dispatch

# Run specific job from any workflow
act -j test
act -j clippy
act -j coverage

# Debugging options
act -v push              # Verbose output
act -n push              # Dry run (show what would run)
act --container-architecture linux/amd64  # Force architecture if needed

# Advanced usage
act -P ubuntu-latest=catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest  # Use specific runner image
act --secret-file .secrets  # Load secrets from file (for testing)
```

**Remaining scripts:**

Minimal scripts kept for specific purposes:

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/ci/pre-push` | Git hook script | Installed via `make setup-hooks` to run checks before push |

## Documentation structure

The project documentation is organized into several categories:

### Source documentation

- **Location:** Inline in `.rs` files
- **Format:** Rust doc comments (`///` and `//!`)
- **Generation:** `cargo doc`
- **Viewing:** `make docs-open`

### User guides

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `README.md` | Project overview and quick start | Root |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution guidelines | Root |

| `docs/PLUGIN_GUIDE.md` | Plugin development guide | docs/ |
| `docs/PLUGIN_TYPES.md` | Plugin type reference | docs/ |
| `docs/API.md` | API documentation | docs/ (auto-generated) |

### Scripts documentation

- **Location:** `scripts/README.md`
- **Purpose:** Documents all automation scripts
- **Categories:** CI, docs, dev, utils

## Testing strategy

### Test categories

1. **Unit tests** - Test individual components
   ```bash
   cargo test --lib
   ```

2. **Integration tests** - Test component interactions
   ```bash
   cargo test --test integration
   ```

3. **Feature tests** - Test feature combinations
   ```bash
   make test-features
   ```

4. **Example validation** - Ensure examples compile
   ```bash
   make examples
   ```

### Coverage requirements

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Generate reports with `make coverage`
- View HTML report: `open .local/reports/index.html`

## Contributing workflow

### Setting up for contributions

1. **Fork and clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/prism-mcp-rs
   cd prism-mcp-rs
   ```

2. **Install Act for local CI testing**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install act
   
   # Linux (see Development Environment Setup section for more options)
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
   
   # Windows
   choco install act-cli
   
   # Verify installation
   act --version
   ```

3. **Set up Git hooks**
   ```bash
   make setup-hooks
   ```

### Making changes

1. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make changes and test**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   vim src/...
   
   # Run quick checks
   make quick
   
   # Run full tests
   make test-all
   ```

3. **Commit with conventional commits**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue"
   git commit -m "docs: update documentation"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   # Create PR on GitHub
   ```

### Pre-push checklist

- [ ] Code formatted: `make fmt`
- [ ] Linting passes: `make clippy`
- [ ] Tests pass: `make test-all`
- [ ] Examples compile: `make examples`
- [ ] Documentation builds: `make docs`
- [ ] No security issues: `make security`

## CI/CD pipeline

### GitHub Actions workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `ci.yml` | Push, PR | Main CI pipeline |
| `security.yml` | Schedule, push | Security audits |
| `release.yml` | Tag push (v*) | Build, publish to crates.io, create GitHub release |
| `dependencies.yml` | Schedule | Dependency updates |
| `benchmarks.yml` | Push to main | Performance benchmarks |

### Local CI simulation with Act

Run the exact same GitHub Actions workflows locally:

```bash
# Run complete CI pipeline
act push

# Run specific workflows
act -W .github/workflows/ci.yml
act -W .github/workflows/security.yml
act -W .github/workflows/benchmarks.yml

# Run specific jobs
act -j test        # Just run tests
act -j clippy      # Just run linting
act -j coverage    # Just run coverage

# Debugging workflows
act -v push        # Verbose output
act -n push        # Dry run to see what would execute
```

**Benefits of using Act:**
- Tests actual GitHub Actions workflows - no duplication
- Uses GitHub's official runner images
- Catches CI issues before pushing
- Supports most GitHub Actions features (secrets, matrices, etc.)

### CI/CD reporting features

The CI pipeline now includes automatic report generation:

#### Coverage reports

- **Generated by:** `cargo-llvm-cov`
- **Output:** `reports/coverage-report.md`
- **Contents:**
  - Overall coverage percentage with badge
  - Line, function, and branch coverage
  - Module-by-module breakdown
  - Uncovered files list
  - Historical trends (when available)

#### Benchmark reports

- **Generated by:** Custom benchmark suite
- **Output:** `reports/benchmark-report.md`
- **Contents:**
  - Client performance metrics (serialization, transport)
  - Server performance metrics (request handling, routing)
  - Plugin performance metrics (tool execution, lifecycle)
  - System information for context
  - Performance comparisons with baselines

#### Viewing reports

**On GitHub:**
- Reports appear in `reports/` folder after main branch pushes
- Download as artifacts from any PR's Actions tab

**Locally:**
```bash
# Generate reports using Act
act -j coverage    # Run coverage job from CI workflow
act -j bench       # Run benchmark job if available

# Or if you have Rust tools installed locally
make coverage      # Generate coverage report
make bench         # Run benchmarks
```

### Token requirements

#### For contributors

**No setup required!** All these features work automatically:
- ✅ Running tests
- ✅ Generating coverage reports
- ✅ Running benchmarks
- ✅ CI validation
- ✅ PR checks

GitHub provides the `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically for each workflow run.

#### For maintainers

**Publishing requires `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`:**
- Set in repository secrets
- Only needed for releases
- Contact repository owner for access

#### For fork owners

**Your fork gets its own tokens:**
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatic, works immediately
- `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`: Add your own if you want to publish

## Release process

### Preparing a release

1. **Update version in `Cargo.toml`**
   ```toml
   version = "0.2.0"  # Bump according to semver
   ```

2. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`**
   - Add release date
   - Summarize changes
   - Credit contributors

3. **Run release checks**
   ```bash
   make release-check
   cargo publish --dry-run  # Verify package will build
   ```

4. **Create PR with version bump**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b release/v0.2.0
   git commit -am "chore: bump version to 0.2.0"
   git push origin release/v0.2.0
   # Create and merge PR
   ```

### Triggering the release

**Option 1: Via git tag (recommended)**

1. **Create and push a git tag**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release version 0.2.0"
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```

**Option 2: Via GitHub Actions UI**

1. Go to Actions → Release workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version number (without 'v' prefix)
4. Click "Run workflow"

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Run full CI pipeline
   - Build release binaries for multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Create a draft GitHub release with assets
   - Publish to crates.io (using secrets.CRATES_IO_TOKEN)
   - Generate and deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
   - Note: The release is created as a draft and needs manual publishing

3. **Monitor the release**
   - Check GitHub Actions for release workflow status
   - Verify package appears on crates.io
   - Confirm docs are updated on docs.rs

### Post-release tasks

1. **Announce the release**
   - Post in Discord/Slack channels
   - Update project website if applicable
   - Tweet/social media if appropriate

2. **Start next development cycle**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b chore/post-release
   # Update Cargo.toml with -dev suffix or next version
   # Add new "Unreleased" section to CHANGELOG.md
   ```

### Important security notes

- **Never run `cargo publish` locally** - This is handled exclusively by CI/CD
- **Crates.io token (`CRATES_IO_TOKEN`)** must only exist in GitHub Secrets
- **Only maintainers with repository write access** can push tags
- **Release drafts** require manual review before publishing
- **Version consistency** is enforced - Cargo.toml version must match the tag

## Performance optimization

### Benchmarking

```bash
# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Compare with baseline
cargo bench -- --baseline main
```

### Profiling

```bash
# CPU profiling
cargo build --release
perf record --call-graph=dwarf ./target/release/example
perf report

# Memory profiling
valgrind --tool=massif ./target/release/example
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Compilation failures:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
make clean
cargo build
```

**Test failures:**
```bash
# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Documentation issues:**
```bash
# Check for broken links
cargo doc --all-features
# Look for warnings in output
```

**Hook not running:**
```bash
# Reinstall hooks
make setup-hooks
# Check hook permissions
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-push
```

## Tool requirements

### Required tools

- Rust 1.85+ (MSRV)
- Cargo
- Git

### Optional tools (for full development)

**Using Act (recommended):**

Act runs your workflows in containers with all tools pre-installed:
- No need to install Rust tools locally
- GitHub's runner images include rustfmt, clippy, and common tools
- Workflows can install additional tools as needed

```bash
# All tools are available in the GitHub Actions runner image
act push           # Runs with all necessary tools
act -j security    # Runs security checks with cargo-audit, cargo-deny
act -j coverage    # Runs coverage with cargo-llvm-cov
```

**Local installation (if preferred):**

If you want to run tools directly without Act:
```bash
make install-tools  # Installs common development tools
```

Common tools:
- `rustfmt` - Code formatting (`rustup component add rustfmt`)
- `clippy` - Linting (`rustup component add clippy`)
- `cargo-audit` - Security auditing (`cargo install cargo-audit`)
- `cargo-llvm-cov` - Coverage (`cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`)
- `cargo-deny` - Dependency checks (`cargo install cargo-deny`)
- `cargo-nextest` - Advanced testing (`cargo install cargo-nextest`)
