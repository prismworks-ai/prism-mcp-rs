# CI/CD Reporting Setup

## ‚úÖ Complete GitHub Actions Integration

The project now has **full automated reporting** integrated into GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## üöÄ What Happens on GitHub

### When You Push to Any Branch:

1. **Coverage Job** runs:
   - Generates LCOV coverage data
   - Creates markdown coverage report
   - Uploads to Codecov.io
   - Saves report as artifact

2. **Benchmark Job** runs:
   - Builds all benchmarks
   - Runs performance tests
   - Generates markdown report
   - Saves report as artifact

### When You Push to `main` Branch:

All of the above PLUS:

3. **Commit Reports Job** runs:
   - Downloads coverage report artifact
   - Downloads benchmark report artifact
   - Commits both reports to `reports/` folder
   - Pushes back to repository with `[skip ci]` tag

## üìä Reports Generated

### Coverage Report (`reports/coverage-report.md`)
- Overall coverage percentage with badge
- Line, function, branch coverage metrics
- Module-by-module breakdown
- Uncovered files list
- Coverage trends over time
- Thresholds and pass/fail status

### Benchmark Report (`reports/benchmark-report.md`)
- Client performance metrics
- Server performance metrics  
- Plugin performance metrics
- System information
- Performance trends
- Comparison with baselines

## üîß GitHub Configuration

### Required Secrets
- ‚úÖ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ `CRATES_IO_TOKEN` - Already configured for publishing

### Branch Protection (Recommended)
Add these status checks as required:
- `test`
- `check`
- `fmt`
- `clippy`
- `doc`
- `coverage`
- `bench`

### Permissions
The workflow has:
- `contents: write` permission for committing reports
- Standard permissions for other operations

## üíª Local Testing

You can test the same reporting locally:

```bash
# Generate both reports
./scripts/ci/local-ci-enhanced.sh --reports

# Run full CI with reports
./scripts/ci/local-ci-enhanced.sh --full

# Quick coverage only
./scripts/ci/simple-coverage.sh
```

## üìà Viewing Reports

### On GitHub:
1. Reports automatically appear in `reports/` folder after push to main
2. Click on any `.md` file to view formatted report
3. Coverage badge shows in report header
4. Trend charts display when history accumulates

### Locally:
```bash
cat reports/coverage-report.md
cat reports/benchmark-report.md
```

### As CI Artifacts:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on any workflow run
3. Download artifacts:
   - `coverage-report`
   - `benchmark-report`

## üîÑ Workflow Details

### File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Coverage Job:**
- Installs cargo-llvm-cov
- Installs bc and jq for report generation
- Runs coverage with all features
- Generates markdown report
- Uploads to Codecov
- Saves report as artifact

**Benchmark Job:**
- Installs bc and jq
- Builds benchmarks with bench feature
- Runs benchmark report script
- Saves report as artifact
- Continues on error (benchmarks are non-critical)

**Commit Reports Job:**
- Only runs on main branch pushes
- Downloads both report artifacts
- Commits to repository
- Uses `[skip ci]` to avoid infinite loops

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Automatic Documentation**: Reports update with every main branch push
2. **Historical Tracking**: Build trend data over time
3. **PR Reviews**: Download artifacts to review coverage/performance changes
4. **Transparency**: Public visibility of code quality metrics
5. **No Manual Work**: Fully automated process

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Reports not appearing in repository:
- Check if pushing to main branch
- Verify GitHub Actions has write permissions
- Look at "Commit Reports" job logs

### Coverage report fails:
- Ensure cargo-llvm-cov installs correctly
- Check if tests are passing
- Verify bc and jq are installed

### Benchmark report fails:
- Check if bench feature builds
- Verify benchmark files compile
- Non-critical - won't fail CI

### Infinite CI loops:
- Commit message includes `[skip ci]`
- This prevents retriggering CI

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

- Add coverage difference comments on PRs
- Include performance regression detection
- Generate release notes from reports
- Add more detailed benchmark metrics
- Create dashboard with historical trends

**Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY CONFIGURED AND READY

The CI/CD reporting infrastructure is complete and will activate automatically when you push to GitHub!
