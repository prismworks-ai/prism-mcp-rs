# Performance & Quality Reports

This directory contains automatically generated reports from CI/CD pipelines.

## Report Types

### ðŸ“Š Coverage Report (`coverage-report.md`)
- Generated by `cargo-llvm-cov` with every CI run
- Shows line, function, and branch coverage percentages
- Identifies uncovered code areas
- Tracks coverage trends over time
- Updates automatically on push to main branch

### âš¡ Benchmark Report (`benchmark-report.md`)
- Performance benchmarks for client, server, and plugin components
- Measures:
  - **Client**: Transport performance, serialization speed
  - **Server**: Request handling, routing efficiency
  - **Plugin**: Tool registration, execution speed
- Compares against previous runs when available
- Includes system information for context

## CI/CD Integration

Reports are generated automatically by GitHub Actions:

1. **On Every Push**: Coverage and benchmarks run
2. **On Main Branch**: Reports are committed back to repository
3. **On Pull Requests**: Reports are available as artifacts

## Local Generation

To generate reports locally:

```bash
# Coverage report
./scripts/ci/generate-coverage-report.sh

# Benchmark report
./scripts/ci/run-benchmarks.sh
```

## Report Format

All reports are in Markdown format for easy viewing on GitHub and include:
- Summary statistics with visual badges
- Detailed breakdowns by module/component
- Trend charts (when historical data available)
- Links to full HTML reports
- Timestamp and commit information

## Thresholds

### Coverage Thresholds
- **Minimum Line Coverage**: 60%
- **Recommended**: 80%+
- **Goal**: 90%+

### Performance Baselines
- Client serialization: < 1ms for typical requests
- Server routing: < 100ns per request
- Plugin execution: < 10ms for simple tools

## Historical Data

Historical metrics are stored in:
- `coverage-history.json`: Coverage trends
- `benchmark-history.json`: Performance trends

These files enable trend visualization in reports.
