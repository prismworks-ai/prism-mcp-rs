# Badge Status Fix Guide

# Current Issues Identified:

# 1. CI Badge Showing "Failing"
**Problem**: Badge reflects cancelled/failed workflow runs
**Solution**: Wait for current CI workflow to complete successfully, or manually trigger a new one

**Status**: üü° IN PROGRESS - CI workflow is currently running

# 2. Release Badge Showing "Failing" 
**Problem**: No recent release workflow runs or failed attempts
**Solution**: Release workflow only runs on tags, so this is expected until next release

**Status**: [x] EXPECTED - Release badge will show "no builds" until next release

# 3. CodeCov Badge Showing "Unknown"
**Problem**: CODECOV_TOKEN not configured in repository secrets
**Solution**: Repository owner needs to add CODECOV_TOKEN secret

**Status**: Warning: NEEDS ADMIN - Requires repository admin to configure

# Actions Taken:

1. [x] Triggered Badge Update workflow
2. [x] Triggered CI workflow manually 
3. [x] Triggered CodeCov Refresh workflow
4. [x] Verified all badge URLs are accessible (200 status)

# Current Workflow Status:

- üü° CI: In progress (should update badge when complete)
- [x] Security: Passing
- [x] Dependencies: Passing 
- [x] Documentation: Passing
- [x] Benchmarks: Passing
- Warning: Release: No recent builds (expected)
- Warning: CodeCov: Unknown (needs CODECOV_TOKEN)

# Expected Timeline:

- **5-10 minutes**: CI workflow completes and badge updates to "passing"
- **Immediate**: Other workflow badges should show "passing" once current runs complete
- **Requires Admin**: CodeCov badge needs CODECOV_TOKEN secret to be configured

# Manual Badge Refresh Commands:

```bash
# Trigger specific workflows manually
gh workflow run "CI" --field reason="Badge refresh"
gh workflow run "Badge Update" --field badge_type=all
gh workflow run "Codecov Refresh"

# Check workflow status
gh run list --limit 10

# Cancel problematic runs if needed
gh run cancel <run_id>

# Re-run successful workflows
gh run rerun <run_id>
```

# Next Steps:

1. ‚è≥ **Wait** for current workflows to complete (5-10 minutes)
2. üîÑ **Refresh** browser cache or check badges again
3. üîë **Configure** CODECOV_TOKEN in repository secrets (admin required)
4. üìä **Monitor** badge status and workflow health going forward

# Badge Management System:

The complete badge management system is now in place:
- [x] Automated weekly badge refresh (Monday 6 AM UTC)
- [x] Manual badge refresh capability 
- [x] Individual workflow triggering
- [x] Badge status monitoring
- [x] Cache-busting for reliable updates
